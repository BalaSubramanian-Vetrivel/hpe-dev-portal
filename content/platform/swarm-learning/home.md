title: HPE Swarm Learning
version: 1.1.0
description: Swarm Learning is a decentralized, privacy-preserving Machine
  Learning framework. This framework utilizes the computing power at, or near,
  the distributed data sources to run the Machine Learning algorithms that train
  the models. It uses the security of a blockchain platform to share learnings
  with peers in a safe and secure manner. In Swarm Learning, training of the
  model occurs at the edge, where data is most recent, and where prompt,
  data-driven decisions are mostly necessary. In this completely decentralized
  architecture, only the insights learned are shared with the collaborating ML
  peers, not the raw data. This tremendously enhances data security and privacy.
