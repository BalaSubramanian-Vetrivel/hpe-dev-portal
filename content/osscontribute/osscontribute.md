title: Be an Open Source Contributor
description: Are you a fan of HPE Developer? Become an HPE Developer Evangelist
  and help us spread the word on how developers, data scientists, and IT
  technologists can write applications and develop integrations for Hewlett
  Packard Enterprise enabled environments. As an HPE Developer Evangelist,
  you’ll be the primary HPE Developer contact for your region/country for
  colleagues, HPE partners and customers. You’ll forward communications to them,
  alerting them of upcoming meetups, Munch & Learn sessions and promoting the
  newest Workshops-on-Demand.

In the world of open source, you need to be fluent with [Git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are not yet, we recommend you read the following 3-part blog series:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-1-getting-started-with-git/)
* [Sharing with the community](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-2-sharing-with-the-commun/)
* [Contributing back](https://developer.hpe.com/blog/get-involved-in-the-open-source-community-part-3-contributing-back-to-th/)

We also offer a Workshop-on-Demand that you can take to get hands-on experience with Git. Feel free to register by clicking below:

* [Getting started with Git](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshop/17)

When you get started with open source, it means that you will either contribute to an existing project or create your own project. If you want to create your own project, don’t forget to create a public repo for it. For HPE employees, be aware that there is an open source review process you need to follow before releasing any code to open source. Make sure you check this [HPE-only website](https://opensource.corp.hpecorp.net/osrp_process_upstream.html).

The HPE Developer Community has highlighted a number of contributors/maintainers in a series of blog posts. Read about their respective journeys and join the team in our Hall of Fame:

One last piece of advice. When joining an existing open source project in order to contribute, you will have to make yourself known to other contributors and maintainers. This might take time. Be patient. Start small by documenting issues in the code or in the documentation and propose a solution. You can also review and comment on proposed changes. In most cases, there will be a Slack or a Gitter forum dedicated to the project. Don’t hesitate to join and start a discussion there. Once your name becomes associated with good feedback and proposals, it will be a lot easier for you to contribute code and get it approved and merged.

And that’s when it gets really exciting.

We estimate that there are 200 million packages on GitHub today, so finding the right place to engage is not that easy. If you are looking for a good project to contribute to, we suggest the following list (in alphabetical order). Enjoy the journey and check out our **[Open Source](https://developer.hpe.com/opensource)** page to learn more about some of the key projects HPE supports.

SPIRE exposes the SPIFFE Workload API, which can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. SPIRE can also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service. |
