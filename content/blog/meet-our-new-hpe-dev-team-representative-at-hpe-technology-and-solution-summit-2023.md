HPE TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS SUMMIT 2023 (HPE TSS 2023) goes physical again this year in sunny Barcelona. After several virtual editions, you will have the pleasure to engage with HPE Developer Community representative. All our sessions will be hold by our new team member : Mathieu Losmede. 

H﻿PE TSS is the largest HPE technical event taking place in EMEA. Whether you are an HPE Presales or Partner, you will have the opportunity to attend technical breakout, Hands-on Labs, as well as strategic keynotes, and also finally get to meet your peers in person!

T﻿he final decision to turn the event into a physical one came late this year. As a resilt, the HPE DEV team will not be able to bring the full physical Hack Shack back in HPE TSS 2023. However, we still come with a few sessions, some Hands-on labs, and a few surprises...

**Meet our new team member: Mathieu Losmede**

M﻿athieu joined our team last summer. He came in with a strong HPE GreenLake background. He was part of the xxxx team where he worked on..... . As the team focus lately shifted to HPE GreenLake Cloud Platform, his arrival  was very fortunate. Mathieu will be all over the place in Barcelona. One might wonder whether he managed to discover the secret of ubiquity...He will delivering several technical breakouts either on his own or in partnership with some other Business Unit representatives (HPE GreenLake, Storage, Compute, and Aruba). He will also be co presenting in other BUs ' sessions. On top of these, he will deliver as well three Hands-on labs based on our well-known [Workshops-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshops) project.
