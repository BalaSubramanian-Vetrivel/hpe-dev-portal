The HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric is about to start a new journey in its delivery of an enterprise grade, Data Fabric for hybrid and multi-Cloud enterprises.

The HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric is a trusted, enterprise-grade data fabric managing data at scale for mission critical applications across industries and use cases. Users today enjoy a single global name space that provides one point to review all attached data assets across data fabric deployments. Multi-modal data access delivers on the need to build an application once and deploy anywhere there is a data fabric through standard APIs. In addition, the multi modal nature of the data fabric allows the development of stream-based, object-based apps and file-based apps against the same data without duplicating that data â€“ very much a single version of the truth. Additionally, and if needed, the data fabric is also good at moving data securely and optimally from fabric to fabric.

The [HPE Ezmeral Early Access program](https://connect.hpe.com/HPEEzmeralEarlyAccess) provides an [HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric beta](https://home.hpe-df.com/) that brings the same enterprise-grade data fabric to the multi-cloud and hybrid enterprise world making the installation, configuration and management of deployments no longer a customer responsibility. The data fabric beta is installed, running and maintained by HPE on any deployment target. Customer-facing management tasks are elevated to the level of creation of buckets, volumes and topics, sharing credentials and entry points with fellow application developers and overall monitoring of usage, all driven through a central UI that can manage all your HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric deployments. 

With the upcoming HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric beta, we are targeting application developers with use-cases in the hybrid and multi-cloud world; for example, those who want to write an application once and run it on any deployment target using a consistent set of multi-modal APIs. It is designed for those who want to build a data plane that gives a consistent view of data assets across clouds via a single global name space and those that want to synchronize data across clouds securely and efficiently. The as-a-service tooling allows the management of all clusters from a single point, further simplifying management of your data plane.

HPE will begin the beta program of this new service in December this year (2022). The program provides testers with access to a fabric, backed by 300 GB of space for file, object and stream capabilities. Once you have signed up, you can access the data fabric landing page in just three clicks. Here, you can directly access end points for files, objects and streams, review consumption, create new volumes, buckets and topics, and also share your fabric with others that you nominate.

We will post additional resources on developer.hpe.com with use cases, example code, product updates videos and other resources. Sign up is on a first come-first served basis. Simply visit this URL: [https://home.hpe-df.com](https://home.hpe-df.com) and provide your company email address (personal email addresses will not be accepted). We will also provide you with [a Slack channel](https://hpedev.slack.com/archives/C044E295003) where you can connect with us to answer any questions you have. Join us to learn more in our upcoming [HPE GreenLake for Data Fabric webinar](https://hpe.zoom.us/webinar/register/3716641878854/WN_xLR2ynonSi6SojUswkVmRw). We look forward to learning about your use cases.
