In this on-demand session, you’ll learn about tips and pitfalls to avoid that will help you speed up your AI projects. You’ll also hear about Champollion, an AI supercomputer built by HPE in collaboration with NVIDIA, which was recently added to the TOP500 list of the most powerful non-distributed computer systems.

#### Accelerating AI Edge to Cloud with NVIDIA and HPE GreenLake ([A41396](https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcfall2022/attendeeportal/page/sessioncatalog?tab.catalogallsessionstab=16566177511100015Kus&search=A41396))

In this Simulive session, HPE subject-matter experts will cover how to combine NVIDIA with HPE GreenLake to accelerate AI edge-to-cloud services. Join in and hear Jeroen Bronkhorst, HPE GreenLake Cloud Services Portfolio Manager for AI/ML, and Terry Chiang, Data Scientist / MLOPs Product Manager for HPE Ezmeral, discuss today’s increased focus on ML model life-cycle management and the new hardware accelerators and optimized open-source tooling that’s popping up at every step of the AI model life cycle. You’ll learn about the latest innovations in data acquisition and preparation, model development and training, and model deployment and inference enabled by HPE, NVIDIA, and partner ecosystems that can be delivered as an on-premises cloud service through HPE GreenLake.

### Attend our Watch Party!

NVIDIA and HPE will also be teaming up for a [Watch Party](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/session-catalog/?search=WP41326b&search=WP41326b%2C+WP41326b&tab.catalogallsessionstab=16566177511100015Kus#/session/1660839912631001SdVF), an interactive session hosted by NVIDIA to interact with other attendees via chat while you watch a GTC session together.
