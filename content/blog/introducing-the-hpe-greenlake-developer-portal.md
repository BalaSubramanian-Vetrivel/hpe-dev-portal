During the executive keynote session at the HPE Discover 2022 Edge-to-Cloud Conference, Antonio Neri, President and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, announced the availability of the HPE GreenLake Developer Portal. He was joined by Fidelma Russo, HPE CTO, and Bryan Thompson, HPE VP of GreenLake Product Management, who gave a quick look at how it provides APIs and documentation to assist developers of all types integrate their apps and services with HPE GreenLake. A [beta version of the portal](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/docs/greenlake) is available today, easily accessed through the [HPE Developer Community portal](https://developer.hpe.com/).

Recently, I had the opportunity to talk with HPE GreenLake Platform Product Manager Navaneethan Venugopalan and HPE Distinguished Technologist Travis Tripp about this eagerly anticipated resource and review it myself. Through the portal, HPE GreenLake customers and partners can take advantage of a well-documented, secure, and scalable framework of APIs for the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.  Starting off by providing material for the HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management service, contents in this resource portal will grow rapidly, so make sure you check it often.

**First off, congratulations on the launch of your new portal. I'm sure our readers are very excited to hear about it. Could you give them a little more detail about the portal?**

Thank you! We’re excited as well. The HPE GreenLake Developer Portal is 100% dedicated to automating integrations with HPE GreenLake. Developers can find all of the official HPE GreenLake API and integration guides there, delivered directly from the HPE GreenLake engineering teams.  It will always contain the most up-to-date and accurate guidance, because it is delivered as part of our end-to-delivery pipeline.  In fact, you will find the very same API and integrations guides there that all of the HPE GreenLake teams use themselves!

**Why did you develop the portal?**

We received numerous requests from our customers and partners to make this information easily available so that developers, data scientists, IT operators, MSP partners, resellers, and 3rd-party systems integrators could automate their interactions with HPE GreenLake.  The announcement of its availability at Discover 2022 was eagerly received. Our customers are excited to be able to automate common and repetitive tasks using these APIs.

**Can anyone, then, access the portal?**

The portal, itself, is easily accessed by anyone – no login is required. Simply visit [developer.greenlake.hpe.com](https://developer.greenlake.hpe.com/) or go through the [HPE Developer Community portal](https://developer.hpe.com/) to access the site. We do offer varying levels of access, though. All the HPE GreenLake APIs support role-based access and you must be authenticated and authorized to use them. Every API in HPE GreenLake is designed with zero trust in mind, meaning that in order to access the API, you must have the correct authorization.  This means that based on the role you’ve been granted in your HPE GreenLake environment will allow you to successfully invoke the relevant APIs. You can always browse the APIs to learn more, but if you happen to be an authorized partner, you’ll get access to even more partner API docs, as we publish API documentation in two categories – public and partner.

**I see that the HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management service is available today. What operational tasks can a developer automate using the HPE GreenLake management console APIs?**

Developers using HPE GreenLake for Compute Ops Management (COM) can automate bulk server lifecycle management tasks (such as updating the firmware of servers), perform power on/off operations, set up policies for establishing firmware baselines, and more. They can also perform monitoring operations to get inventory and health status, to name a few. COM has been purpose-built to be API first; pretty much any operation that can be performed via the UI can be performed via the API.

**What additional APIs will you be adding in the not-too-distant future and when might we expect them?**

HPE GreenLake for Containers, Storage, and Private Cloud Enterprise are some of the services that will become available in the next 4-6 months.

**At the Discover event, were there any specific things customers requested?**

Customers at the event asked that we ensure it is kept up-to-date with the most current and accurate information, which we are able to do considering how it is part of our end-to-delivery pipeline.  They also requested support for tools like Terraform and Ansible. They were even interested in contributing to it with open source tools and libraries. Finally, they asked for a way to provide feedback and suggestions, which we’re currently looking into.

**I wish you much success with the portal and look forward to working with you and your team more closely to compliment your site with HPE GreenLake-related blog posts, workshops, and technical talks on the HPE Developer Community portal.**

We do as well. As you know, the [HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform page](https://developer.hpe.com/platform/hpe-greenlake/home/) on the HPE Developer Community site already links to over a dozen blog posts and tutorials. There’s already one HPE GreenLake related [Workshop-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshops), and we expect that more will be added soon. We’ve been invited to participate in the Munch & Learn talks and Meetup sessions, and we look forward to doing that as well.
