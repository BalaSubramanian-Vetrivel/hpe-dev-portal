The pace of open source machine learning (ML) innovation has dramatically accelerated in the last 18 months. Open source has reduced the costs of ML development and sped up development cycles. Built upon the widely popular open source Determined Training Platform, the HPE Machine Learning Development Environment (MLDE) helps developers and scientists focus on innovation by removing the complexity and cost associated with machine learning model development. 

In this meetup, youâ€™ll be exposed to the Determined platform and how it integrates the latest, innovative open source AI/ML technologies, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and DeepSpeed. As an open source platform, Determined can rapidly integrate new libraries to further accelerate distributed ML model training. The Determined community provides testing and feedback to help drive new features. HPE MLDE customers benefit from the upstream Determined platform by virtue of it being a stable, enterprise-grade solution. You'll also hear about Champollion, an AI Supercomputer built by HPE & NVIDIA, for hands-on testing of HPE MLDE.
